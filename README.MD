This is a portable music tracker built for CircuitPython devices, specifically the Adafruit Pybadge and PyGamer platforms. Heavily inspired by LSDJ and Nanoloop.

The project is still in the very early stages of development and will change when new APIs become available, but so far it looks quite possible.

Includes the waveform generator files from the Adafruit Learning System.

Milestones:
TO DO

[] wave mixing

[] draw triangle waveshape

[] draw noise waves

[] algorithm for frequency mapping so that it reads out in Hz

[] move cursor, navigation

[] impliment pages as displayio groups

[] envelope (ADSR)

[] tempo control, should be (1/BPM/60) seconds for each step
